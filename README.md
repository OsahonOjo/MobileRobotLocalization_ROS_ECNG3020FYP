# Localization of Heterogeneous Mobile Robots in a Cooperative Navigation/Mapping Context

>NOTE:  
>This repository contains the ROS-related files that were used in my final year project, titled "Localization of Heterogeneous Mobile Robots in a Cooperative Navigation/Mapping Context," at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine.
>
>The final completed scene file for the project is the one named, "localizations.ttt." The other files contain objects and scenes that were created while I was learning CoppeliaSim and trying out ideas for the project.

The goal of this project was to explore the effectiveness of algorithms for using and updating a probabilistic map shared by heterogenous robots navigating in a closed space.
